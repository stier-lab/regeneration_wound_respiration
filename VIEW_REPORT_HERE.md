## What's Inside

### Executive Summary
- Study overview with key findings
- Updated location: **Moorea, French Polynesia**
- Updated species: **Porites spp.** (not compressa)
- Final QC: **117 measurements** (11 excluded, 8.6%)

### Main Results (Day 7 Peak Response)

#### Porites spp.
- **Control:** -0.39 Â± 0.07 Âµmol Oâ‚‚/cmÂ²/hr (n=5) - **Now stable!**
- **Small Wound:** -0.27 Â± 0.03 (n=5)
- **Large Wound:** -0.35 Â± 0.04 (n=6)

#### Acropora pulchra
- **Control:** 1.48 Â± 0.81 Âµmol Oâ‚‚/cmÂ²/hr (n=5)
- **Small Wound:** 0.22 Â± 0.03 (n=5)
- **Large Wound:** 0.21 Â± 0.01 (n=5)

### Figures Included
1. Experimental timeline
2. Representative Oâ‚‚ traces
3. Surface area distributions
4. **Main Result:** Temporal dynamics across all timepoints
5. Peak response comparison
6. Photosynthesis rates
7. P:R ratios

### Quality Control Section
Details the **3-phase QC process**:
- Phase 1: 6 Acropora (physiologically impossible)
- Phase 2: 4 measurements (probe issues)
- Phase 3: 1 Porites control (**the outlier you identified!**)

Shows before/after comparison demonstrating impact of removing coral 54.

### Statistical Tables
- Complete summary by species, timepoint, treatment
- Sample sizes for all groups
- Means Â± SE for all measurements
- Recovery data with paired comparisons

## Key Improvement from Your Question

**You asked about the Porites control dip at Day 7** - this led to finding and removing a critical outlier:

**Before removal:**
- Porites Control Day 7: -0.63 Â± 0.25 (anomalous dip)

**After removal:**
- Porites Control Day 7: -0.39 Â± 0.07 (stable, consistent)

This single change dramatically improved the biological interpretation!
