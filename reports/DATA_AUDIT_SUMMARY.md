# Data Audit Summary - Wound Respiration Project
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Auditor:** Claude Code Analysis

---

## Overview

This project examines the effects of wounding on respiration rates in **Porites** and **Acropora pulchra** corals at controlled temperature. The experiment was conducted in Moorea, French Polynesia in May-June 2023.

### Sample Design
- **Total corals:** 36 (18 Acropora, 18 Porites)
- **Treatments per genus:**
  - Control (treatment 0): 6 corals
  - Wound type 1 (treatment 1): 6 corals
  - Wound type 2 (treatment 2): 6 corals
- **Wound date:** 2023-05-27
- **Coral ID range:** 41-58 (IDs are **reused** between genera!)

### Critical Data Note
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Coral IDs 41-58 are used for BOTH Acropora and Porites. Always use `coral_id + genus` together as a compound key when joining datasets.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Balanced experimental design** - Equal replication across treatments
2. **Complete metadata** - All corals tracked with treatment assignments
3. **Multiple timepoints** - Good temporal resolution (4 timepoints over 23 days)
4. **Multiple physiological measures** - Respiration, photosynthesis, growth, Fv/Fm, surface area
5. **Porites data fully processed** - Ready for analysis

### ⚠️ Issues to Address

1. **Acropora respirometry not yet processed**
   - Raw multi-channel files exist
   - Need to run `Resp.R` to extract individual coral time series
   - Then run `PRrates.R` to calculate O2 exchange rates

2. **Missing visualization PDFs for 2023-06-03 respiration**
   - Rates were calculated but plots not generated
   - May need to re-run with plotting enabled

3. **Coral ID ambiguity**
   - Same IDs used for both genera
   - All downstream scripts must handle `coral_id + genus` as compound key

4. **Temperature data**
   - Not found in sample_info
   - Need to check if experiment was at single controlled temperature
   - May be in raw respirometry files (temp column exists)

## Data Processing Status

### Scripts Available
| Script | Location | Purpose | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| `mass_volume.R` | Growth/Scripts/ | Calculate dry mass from buoyant weight | Ready |
| `Resp.R` | Respirometry/Scripts/ | Extract individual coral O2 time series | Ready (needs Acropora run) |
| `PRrates.R` | Respirometry/Scripts/ | Calculate respiration/photosynthesis rates | Ready (needs Acropora run) |
| `SA.calculations.R` | Surface_Area/Scripts/ | Calculate surface areas from wax data | Ready |
| `fvfm.R` | PAM/Scripts/ | Process Fv/Fm measurements | Ready |

### Processing Workflow
```
1. Growth → mass_volume.R → dry mass & chamber volumes
2. Raw runs → Resp.R → individual coral O2 time series
3. Individual files → PRrates.R → normalized O2 rates
4. Wax data → SA.calculations.R → surface areas
5. PAM data → fvfm.R → averaged Fv/Fm per coral
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Process Acropora respirometry data**
   - Run `Resp.R` for Acropora samples from all dates
   - Create `Acropora/` subfolders parallel to `Porites/`

2. ✅ **Calculate rates for Acropora**
   - Run `PRrates.R` on Acropora time series
   - Generate output in `Respirometry/Output/Acropora/`

3. ✅ **Test existing pipeline**
   - Verify all scripts run without errors
   - Check output formats match expected structure

4. ✅ **Create integrated analysis**
   - Build R Markdown combining all measurements
   - Statistical models following "similar analysis" template
   - Generate publication-quality figures

### Analysis Strategy
Focus analysis on **controlled temperature** conditions:
- Extract temperature from respirometry files
- Filter for consistent temp conditions
- Primary comparison: **wound effect on respiration rates**
- Secondary measures: photosynthesis, growth, Fv/Fm correlation
