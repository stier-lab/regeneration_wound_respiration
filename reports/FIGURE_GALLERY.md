## How to Regenerate Figures

```bash
# Growth figures
Rscript scripts/01_process_growth.R

# Surface area figures
Rscript scripts/03b_calculate_adjusted_surface_areas.R

# PAM figures
Rscript scripts/02_process_pam.R

# Check output
ls -lh reports/Figures/*.png
```

**Note:** No `Rplots.pdf` should be created. If it appears, check that:
1. Growth script uses `ggsave()` for all plots
2. Surface area script uses `ggsave()` for all plots
3. PAM script has `pdf(NULL)` at the beginning
