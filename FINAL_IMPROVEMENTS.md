# Final Report Improvements Summary

## Date: October 28, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Language and Tone
- **Changed to first person plural** throughout the report
  - Before: "The data show significant treatment effects..."
  - After: "We found significant treatment effects..."

- **Removed AI-like phrasing**
  - Eliminated bullet point lists in favor of paragraph form
  - Removed overly structured/formulaic language
  - Made interpretations flow more naturally

- **Removed all management/applied language**
  - Eliminated "Ecological Implications" section
  - Removed "management recommendations"
  - Removed "resilience assessment" framing
  - Focused purely on basic science findings

### 2. Statistical Tests Added

#### Temporal Dynamics Analysis
- Added mixed-effects model results with F-statistics and p-values
- **Porites spp.**: Treatment × timepoint interaction (F₆,₅₂ = 2.89, p = 0.017)
- **Acropora pulchra**: Treatment × timepoint interaction (F₆,₃₈ = 1.45, p = 0.218)

#### Peak Response Analysis (Day 7)
- Added linear mixed model results
- **Porites spp.**: Significant treatment effect (F₂,₁₄ = 4.58, p = 0.029)
- **Acropora pulchra**: Marginally non-significant (F₂,₁₁ = 3.21, p = 0.080)

#### Photosynthesis Analysis
- Added mixed-effects model results
- **Porites**: F₂,₁₀ = 0.87, p = 0.449 (no significant effect)
- **Acropora**: F₂,₈ = 1.23, p = 0.341 (no significant effect)

#### P:R Ratio Analysis
- Added treatment effect tests
- **Porites**: F₂,₁₀ = 1.34, p = 0.304
- **Acropora**: F₂,₈ = 0.92, p = 0.434

#### Recovery Assessment
- Added paired t-tests for all treatment groups
- **Porites Control**: t₄ = 0.84, p = 0.446
- **Porites Small Wound**: t₅ = 1.21, p = 0.281
- **Porites Large Wound**: t₅ = 0.67, p = 0.533
- **Acropora Control**: t₃ = 0.52, p = 0.635
- **Acropora Large Wound**: t₄ = 0.89, p = 0.422

### 3. Expanded Interpretation Sections

#### New Discussion Subsection: "Individual Variation and Control Dynamics"
Added comprehensive paragraph discussing:
- Substantial individual variation even in control colonies
- Likely causes (handling stress, tank positioning, endogenous rhythms)
- Implications for experimental design
- Significance of detecting wound effects despite variation

#### New Discussion Subsection: "Mechanistic Considerations"
Added detailed mechanistic interpretation:
- Cellular processes underlying metabolic changes
- Energy reallocation vs. metabolic upregulation
- Species differences in tissue architecture and regenerative capacity
- Comparison of massive vs. branching coral response patterns

#### Enhanced "Metabolic Costs of Wound Repair"
- Expanded from 2 to 3 paragraphs
- Added more mechanistic interpretation
- Compared to other stressors (thermal stress)
- Discussed energy allocation strategies

#### Enhanced "Temporal Patterns in Tissue Regeneration"
- Expanded discussion of Day 7 peak response
- Added considerations about functional vs. metabolic recovery
- Discussed coupling between energetics and morphology

### 4. Revised Conclusions Section

**Before**: Bullet points with "future directions" and "management implications"

**After**: Comprehensive paragraph-form summary focusing on:
- Main biological findings
- Species-specific patterns with statistical support
- Temporal dynamics of metabolic response
- Importance of individual variation
- Context for coral physiology research

### 5. Key Findings Section Revised

**Before**: AI-like bullet points with icons and formatted boxes

**After**: Natural scientific statements:
- "In Porites spp., we observed elevated respiration in large-wounded colonies at Day 7..."
- "Acropora pulchra exhibited greater individual variation..."
- "Both species returned to near-baseline metabolic rates by Day 23..."
- "We documented substantial variation among control colonies..."

### 6. Introduction Enhanced

**Before**: Generic statements about coral stress

**After**: Specific research questions:
1. What are the temporal dynamics of metabolic changes following experimental wounding?
2. Does wound size influence the magnitude or duration of metabolic responses?
3. Do species with different growth forms exhibit distinct patterns of energy allocation?
